Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository 
    > `git clone https://github.com/IvelinP30/what-to-watch.git`
    > cd WhatToWatch
2. Configure TMDB API key
    - You need an API key from TMDB
    - Create a file application.yaml inside the backend resources (typically under src/main/resources/) with:
    > tmdb:
        > api:
            > key: your_tmdb_api_key_here
        > base:
            > url: https://api.themoviedb.org/3
3. Configure PostgreSQL connection
    - In application.yaml, add your database settings like:
    > spring:
        > datasource:
            > url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/your_database
            > username: your_username
            > password: your_password
        > jpa:
            > hibernate:
            > ddl-auto: update
            > show-sql: true
4. Run backend
    - Use Maven to build and run:
    > ./mvnw clean install
    > ./mvnw spring-boot:run
5. Setup frontend
    - Navigate to the React frontend folder:
    > cd frontend
    - Create .env.local file with:
    > VITE_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
    >  VITE_DB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_tmdb_api_key_here
6. Install and run frontend
    > npm install
    > npm run dev
7. Access app
    - Open your browser at http://localhost:3000

## Notes

The backend API handles user accounts, favorites, watchlists, and recommendations.
Frontend communicates with the backend to manage user sessions and display movie data.
Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running and accessible before starting backend.
